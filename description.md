# CC Chunk Loader

A dynamic chunk loading mod for ComputerCraft turtles that goes beyond traditional always-on/always-off chunk loaders.

## Why This Mod?

I wasn't happy with existing chunk loading options for ComputerCraft setups. Standard chunk loaders are either always active or completely off - there's no middle ground for dynamic, intelligent chunk management.

**CC Chunk Loader** solves this by giving turtles the ability to dynamically scale their chunk loading based on what they're actually doing, with remote management capabilities for distributed automation systems.

## Core Features

### üîÑ **Dynamic Chunk Loading**
- Turtles can adjust their chunk loading radius through code (0 to 2.5 chunks by default)
- Perfect for tasks that need different area coverage at different times
- Automatic shutdown when fuel runs out prevents abandoned chunk loaders

### üîã **Fuel-Based Balancing** 
- Powered by turtle fuel with exponential cost scaling by distance
- Random ticking support for farms (doubles fuel cost)
- Fractional fuel debt system for precise cost calculation
- All costs are fully configurable

### üì° **Remote Management**
- Wake up dormant turtles by ID even in unloaded chunks
- Control any turtle's chunk loading remotely through the manager block
- Persistent UUID system tied to computer IDs, not positions
- Perfect for managing distributed automation without keeping everything loaded

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Smart Persistence**
- Complete state preservation across server restarts
- Wake-on-world-load option for critical turtles
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned peripherals
- No data loss due to dormancy

## API Reference

### Chunkloader Peripheral

```lua
local chunkloader = peripheral.find("chunkloader")

-- Core chunk loading control
chunkloader.setRadius(radius)           -- Set loading radius (0-2.5, 0 = disabled)
chunkloader.getRadius()                 -- Get current radius
chunkloader.getFuelRate()              -- Get fuel consumption per tick

-- Wake control
chunkloader.setWakeOnWorldLoad(boolean) -- Auto-resume on server restart
chunkloader.getWakeOnWorldLoad()        -- Check wake setting

-- Random tick control (for farms)
chunkloader.setRandomTick(boolean)      -- Enable random ticking (doubles fuel cost)
chunkloader.getRandomTick()            -- Check random tick status

-- Turtle identification
chunkloader.getTurtleIdString()         -- Get unique turtle ID for remote management
chunkloader.hasUUID()                  -- Check if turtle has persistent ID
```

### Chunkloader Manager Block

```lua
local manager = peripheral.find("chunkloader_manager")

-- Remote turtle management
manager.getTurtleInfo(turtleId)                    -- Get turtle status/stats
manager.setTurtleRadius(turtleId, radius)          -- Wake & control dormant turtles
manager.setTurtleWakeOnWorldLoad(turtleId, boolean) -- Control wake settings remotely
manager.getTurtleWakeOnWorldLoad(turtleId)         -- Check wake settings
manager.listTurtles()                              -- List all active turtles
```

## Use Cases

### üåæ **Smart Farming Systems**
- Turtles enable chunk loading and random ticking only when tending crops
- Scale down to minimal radius when just monitoring
- Remote activation when crops are ready for harvest

### ‚õèÔ∏è **Mining Operations**
- Dynamic radius based on mining area size
- Auto-shutdown when fuel runs low
- Remote coordination of multiple mining turtles

### üìä **Monitoring Networks**
- Wake dormant sensor turtles on-demand
- Collect data across large areas without constant chunk loading
- Centralized management through manager blocks

## Technical Highlights

- **UUID-based persistence** - Turtle identities survive world restarts and position changes
- **Computer ID lifecycle management** - Automatic cleanup when peripherals are unequipped
- **Exponential fuel scaling** - Larger areas cost exponentially more fuel to prevent abuse
- **Atomic state management** - No race conditions in multi-turtle setups
- **Custom block models** - Polished visual design
- **Comprehensive admin tools** - Debug commands for troubleshooting complex setups

## Installation

1. Requires **Fabric** and **CC: Tweaked**
2. Drop the mod file in your `mods` folder
3. Items appear in Redstone creative tab

## Configuration

All fuel costs and limits are configurable via in-game commands:

```
/ccchunkloader get <key>          # View current settings
/ccchunkloader set <key> <value>  # Modify settings
/ccchunkloader list               # Show all config values
```

**Default Settings:**
- Max radius: 2.5 chunks (covers ~21 chunks total)
- Base fuel cost: 0.033 per chunk per tick
- Random tick max radius: 1.4 chunks
- Distance multiplier: 2.0 (exponential scaling)

## Advanced Features

### Debug Commands
```
/ccchunkloader debug uuids        # List all tracked UUIDs
/ccchunkloader debug stats        # Show system statistics
/ccchunkloader debug orphans      # Find orphaned UUIDs
```

### Remote Bootstrap
- Manager blocks can wake turtles in unloaded chunks
- Persistent state ensures no data loss during dormancy
- Wake-on-world-load for critical automation systems

---

**Perfect for:** Dynamic automation systems, large-scale turtle networks, smart resource management, and anyone who wants intelligent chunk loading instead of static always-on solutions.
