Current State: Working But Inefficient

The radius override system now works reliably, but logs show several inefficiencies that should be
optimized for better performance and cleaner operation.

Optimization Phases

Phase 1: Eliminate Double Peripheral Creation

- Add peripheral existence checks before bootstrap attempts
- Implement peripheral creation coordination to prevent race conditions
- Add mutex/locking around peripheral creation process
- Expected Result: Single peripheral creation per turtle activation

Phase 2: Optimize State Management

- Implement batched state saves instead of individual calls
- Add "dirty" flag system to prevent unnecessary state saves
- Reduce state save frequency during command processing chains
- Expected Result: ~60% reduction in state save operations

Phase 3: Bootstrap Timing Improvements

- Add bootstrap cancellation when peripheral loads naturally
- Improve bootstrap detection logic to avoid redundant attempts
- Coordinate bootstrap process with natural peripheral creation
- Expected Result: Eliminate "BOOTSTRAP PARTIAL" warnings

Phase 4: Command Processing Optimization

- Prevent duplicate command processing between bootstrap and natural loading
- Add command processing coordination/locks
- Optimize event firing to reduce redundant events
- Expected Result: Single command processing per operation

Phase 5: Logging and Performance

- Reduce verbose logging for normal operations (keep for errors)
- Add performance metrics and timing logs
- Clean up redundant log messages
- Expected Result: Cleaner logs, better performance visibility

Files to Modify

- TurtleStateEvents.java - Bootstrap coordination and event optimization
- ChunkLoaderPeripheral.java - State save batching and peripheral creation locks
- TurtleCommandQueue.java - Command processing coordination
- ChunkManager.java - State management optimization

Expected Outcomes

- Performance: 40-60% reduction in redundant operations
- Reliability: Eliminate race conditions and timing issues
- Maintainability: Cleaner logs and better debugging
- User Experience: Faster command execution, less log spam








Implementation Plan

Phase 1: Add Chunk Unload Detection

- Implement chunk unload event listener in CCChunkloader.java
- When turtle's chunk unloads → immediately call peripheral.cleanup() and remove from registry
- This eliminates zombie peripherals at the source

Phase 2: Modify Bootstrap Logic

- Remove all peripheral existence checks from bootstrap (TurtleStateEvents.java)
- Bootstrap always assumes turtle is fully dormant
- Simplify onCommandQueued() to: dormant turtle → bootstrap, active turtle → process

Phase 3: Remove Race Condition Handling

- Delete attemptTurtleChunkBootstrap() method (no longer needed)
- Remove isTurtleChunkLoaded() checks (if peripheral exists, chunk is loaded)
- Simplify event processing logic significantly

Phase 4: Clean Up State Management

- Remove redundant peripheral creation coordination
- Simplify ChunkLoaderPeripheral constructor (no race condition handling needed)
- Remove duplicate state saves during peripheral creation

Phase 5: Optimize Command Processing

- Commands for dormant turtles → always bootstrap
- Commands for active turtles → immediate processing
- No more complex bootstrap coordination needed

Expected Results

- Eliminate all race conditions - if peripheral exists, turtle is definitely loaded
- No memory leaks - peripherals only exist when turtles are actually loaded
- Simpler code - remove ~200 lines of race condition handling
- Cleaner logs - no more "BOOTSTRAP PARTIAL" or double creation messages
- Better performance - no zombie peripherals consuming memory

Files to Modify

1. CCChunkloader.java - Add chunk unload event listener
2. TurtleStateEvents.java - Simplify bootstrap logic, remove chunk loading checks
3. ChunkLoaderPeripheral.java - Simplify constructor, remove race condition handling
4. ChunkLoaderRegistry.java - Add bulk cleanup methods

Key Insight

"Active" peripheral = turtle is definitely loaded and available
"No" peripheral = turtle is dormant and needs bootstrap
This eliminates the problematic "active but unloaded" state entirely.
